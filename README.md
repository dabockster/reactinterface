# ReactInterface

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

This is a demo project that I used for following along with a LinkedIn course created by Ray Villalobos. Use any of this code at your own risk!

## Misc Explanations & Notes

React Icons - Icon library like Font Awesome but only transmits the icons you're explicitly using to the browser
Tailwind CSS - "Post CSS" framework that only transmits the CSS classes you're explicitly using to the browser
